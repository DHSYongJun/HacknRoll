# Rolling Arcade (HacknRoll submission for 2019)

3 minigames developed for Sphero Bolt
These include:

* Speed Tilt
  * Tilt the green side to earn points within the given time. If shown a reverse sign, tilt the opposite direction. Time given will be shorter every 5 points earned.
* Bomber
  * When a bomb appears, throw your Sphero upwards to avoid exploding it. Players will have 3 lives.
* Punch
  * Shake the Sphero as fast as you can until you hear "Stop". Place it on the floor and let it roll. The harder you shake, the further the distance.
